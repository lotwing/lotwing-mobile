<h2>Building iOS</h2>

1. Make sure your scheme has the correct settings for Release target (Lotwing)
2. In XCODE, navigate to `Project > Archive`
3. Say yes to every prompt, the default selection is correct.
4. Once it has finished building, upload it. Again say yes / continue on every step.
5. When it finishes uploading, it will run in the app store build process, after which a new TestFlight build will become available
6. To publish a public release, proceed in the appstoreconnect > App Store > + Version or Platform workflow

<h2> Building Android </h2>

- (ONLY ONCE) Set up keychain access key for the keystore [guide](https://medium.com/@hasangi/making-a-signed-apk-for-your-react-native-application-98e8529678db):

1. (MAC) Open Keychain Access
2. Add a new password by pressing the plus sign
3. As name, put 'com_lotwing_keystore'. Fill in the account name as 'lotwing'. The password is a secret and you can get it from product owners (it should be kept in a safe place and not transmitted unencrypted)
4. Using the [generated](https://medium.com/@hasangi/making-a-signed-apk-for-your-react-native-application-98e8529678db) signing file, put it into the `android/app` folder. Don't commit the file

- Build apk

1. MAKE SURE THE .env is correct depending on your build scope
2. In `android` run `./gradlew assembleRelease`
3. When it finishes, the .apk is available in `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`
4. Upload it to the google play console
5. To publish a public release, proceed in the google play store (beta release -> promote to public)
